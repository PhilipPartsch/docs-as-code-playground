Stakeholder Specification for Merge Python Dictionaries
#######################################################

As Developer, I often have to merge `python dictionaries <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp>`_.

.. stake_req:: Merge python dictionaries
   :id: CSTRQ_MERGE_DICTS
   :author: PhilipPartsch

   Provide a python module with a function to merge a list of
   python dictionaries to one dictionary.

.. stake_req:: Detect merge conflicts
   :id: CSTRQ_DETECT_MERGE_CONFLICTS
   :author: PhilipPartsch

   As multiple dictionaries could have for the same Key different
   defined Values, the python module shall report merge conflicts.
